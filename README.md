# My Tasks

This project demonstrates the access to the tasks of a keytech PLM/DMS user.

The project has not been developed for productive use, but is intended to provide a simple introduction to the use of the keytech web api.

Since most of the keytech customers are German speaking, the user interface is displayed in German.

## Getting Started
The project was created with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) Version 1.0.0-rc.0.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Set up the Development Environment
You need to set up your development environment first. See [Angular QuickStart Guide](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart) for further information.

Install [Node.jsÂ® and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if they are not already on your machine.

```
Verify that you are running at least node 6.9.x and npm 3.x.x by running node -v and npm -v in a terminal/console window.
```

Then install the Angular CLI globally:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Get the Code
Download or clone the repo: 
```
git clone https://github.com/keytechSoftware/my-tasks.git
```
To clone the repo, Git must of course be installed on the local computer. To set up Git please see [Set Up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) for details.
